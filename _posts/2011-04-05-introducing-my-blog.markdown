title: Introducing my blog
---
Hello, everybody. Or, should I say, "Hello World" (I know, it's a lousy joke :P)

I have created this blog so that I can post news about my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project. Currently, I haven't been accepted yet, I haven't even submitted the proposal. But if it does get accepted, this blog will be updated weekly with news about the project.

What I'll submit this year to The Perl Foundation (TPF) is a proposal to rework the Catalyst component setup system to use Bread::Board. Check out the <a href="/proposal-rework-catalyst-component-setup-code">proposal</a> for more details.

If I do get accepted, and conclude it, I'll use this blog to talk about future projects. Hence the name perl.andrewalker.net. I don't want it to be GSoC specific.

I'm also making it multilingual, because I'm Brazilian, and most of Perl community can't read Portuguese. But most of my friends are Brazilian, and some of them can't read English. So you get the point. I tried to get a blog system written in Perl, but none had a good multilingual system like <a href="http://wpml.org">WPML</a> (which, unfortunatly, has just become commercial, so I'm using the free legacy version). So, ironically, my Perl blog is written in PHP, haha, it's WordPress. I'm open to suggestions though.
