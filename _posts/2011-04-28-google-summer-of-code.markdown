title: Google Summer of Code?
---
So, you have heard something about Google Summer of Code and you are wondering what the heck is that. Perhaps you have seen some tweets by me that got you thinking, or you heard somewhere else, and ended up in my blog.

Whichever the case, I'll try to make a very simple and introductory post explaining what is that.

From the project's <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">homepage</a>, here is a brief description:

<blockquote>Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects. We have worked with several open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund several projects over a three month period. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together over 4500 successful student participants and over 3000 mentors from over 100 countries worldwide, all for the love of code. Through Google Summer of Code, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic pursuits. In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers. Best of all, more source code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.</blockquote>

So, simply put, GSoC is a project that pays students to work on free software during the summer. I'm not sure what Google motivation is, but for some reason they pay a huge amount of money to support free software every year during summer, through that project. I find it a very good idea =P

I'll give an example of how it works, using a widely known free software: Mozilla Firefox. So, suppose I'm a student, and I have an idea to improve Firefox. As Mozilla is one of the organizations that join GSoC, I can send a proposal to Mozilla explaining what I can do for 3 months that can improve Firefox. This year, this part happened in the beginning of April. If they accept me, they will assign me a mentor, who will help me develop my idea, and Google will finance, both the mentor and me. After I get accepted, there is a period called "Community Bonding", in which I can study how to implement my proposal, and also get more involved with the community, i.e. other Mozilla developers, etc. After May 23rd, I would begin coding, and by the end of August, I should have my project delivered.

Well, you can read more here: <a href="http://www.booki.cc/gsocstudentguide/_v/1.0/what-is-google-summer-of-code/">http://www.booki.cc/gsocstudentguide/_v/1.0/what-is-google-summer-of-code/</a>.

In my case, I didn't apply to Mozilla. If you are not a programmer, you probably never heard of the organization I sent my proposal to: it's called <a href="http://http://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a>. You can read my <a href="/proposal-rework-catalyst-component-setup-code/">proposal</a> for more details. There is a Perl framework called <a href="http://catalystframework.org">Catalyst</a> (similar to Rails, or Django). I want to rework the way the Catalyst framework loads it's components. So I'll be working on that from May 23rd to August 22nd, approximately. My mentors are <a href="http://bobtfish.livejournal.com/">Tomas Doran</a> and <a href="http://blog.edencardim.com/">Eden Cardim</a>. I'll have another post explaining that better, very soon.
